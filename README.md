# Bonded Warehouse Initiative Problem Summary:

## 📌 Overview
- The case involves a Canadian importer of golf equipment facing seasonal demand fluctuations.
- Products include golf shoes, gloves, outerwear, and club heads.
- Inventory must be procured 4–6 months in advance due to supplier constraints, leading to early duty payments and cash flow challenges.

## ❗ Business Challenge
- Early payment of import duties strains cash flow.
- The company seeks to optimize capital usage and improve financial flexibility.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- Evaluate the use of a **Canada Customs Bonded Warehouse (CCBW)**.
- **CCBW Benefits**:
  - Delay duty and tax payments until goods are withdrawn from storage (up to 4 years).
  - Potential to reinvest freed-up capital into growth initiatives.

## 💰 Financial Details
- **Duty Rates**:
  - Shoes: 19%
  - Gloves: 13%
  - Club Heads: 5%
  - Outerwear: 18.5%
- **Monthly Storage Costs per Carton**:
  - Shoes: \$0.36
  - Gloves: \$0.22
  - Club Heads: \$0.44
  - Outerwear: \$0.32
- **Warehouse Capacity**: Maximum of 200 pallets at any time.
- The company can invest capital at a 13% yearly rate.

## ⚙️ Operational Constraints
- Monthly limits on how many pallets of each product type can be stored offsite.
- Flexibility to store remaining inventory onsite, but duties must be paid immediately.
- No obligation to use full offsite storage capacity.

## 🎯 Objective
- Determine whether the cash flow savings from deferred duty payments justify the additional storage costs.
